The purpose of building this app is to have fun and experiment with AI-driven coding assistants. Also, to try new technologies for DB and Storage, such as Supabase.

React in the Front (with Vite and WindTailCSS)
Node.js in the Back
Supabase for data and media storage.

Eventually, this will be hosted on a cloud provider like AWS or Azure.

CI/CD approach still to be defined.

It will be required to make some configuration tricks to enable geolocation on mobile devices. HTTPS is required for it, so even in development, localhost presents some challenges.
